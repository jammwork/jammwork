# Plugin Architecture

This document explains the architectural principles and design patterns behind the Jammwork plugin system.

## Overview

The Jammwork plugin system is designed to be:
- **Modular**: Plugins are self-contained units with clear boundaries
- **Extensible**: New functionality can be added without modifying core code
- **Safe**: Plugins run in controlled environments with limited access
- **Performant**: Minimal overhead for plugin loading and execution

## Core Components

### Plugin Manager
The central orchestrator that handles plugin lifecycle:
- **Loading**: Discovers and initializes plugins
- **Registration**: Manages plugin registration and dependencies
- **Communication**: Facilitates inter-plugin communication
- **Cleanup**: Ensures proper resource disposal

### Plugin API
The interface between plugins and the core system:
- **Canvas Operations**: Drawing, selection, transformation
- **Event System**: Subscribe to and emit events
- **Tool Registration**: Add custom tools to the toolbar
- **UI Components**: Register overlay components and layers

### Plugin Interface
The contract that all plugins must implement:

```typescript
interface Plugin {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  version: string;
  description?: string;
  author?: string;
  dependencies?: string[];
  
  activate(api: PluginAPI): Promise<void>;
  deactivate(): Promise<void>;
}
```

## Architectural Patterns

### Dependency Injection
The plugin system uses dependency injection to provide plugins with necessary services:

```typescript
// Core services are injected through the PluginAPI
export interface PluginAPI {
  canvas: CanvasService;
  tools: ToolService;
  events: EventService;
  ui: UIService;
}
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
Plugins communicate through a pub/sub event system:
- Loose coupling between plugins
- Async communication patterns
- Event namespacing for organization

### Disposable Pattern
All plugin registrations return disposables for cleanup:

```typescript
const toolDisposable = api.registerTool(myTool);
const layerDisposable = api.registerLayerComponent(MyLayer);

// Cleanup on deactivation
toolDisposable.dispose();
layerDisposable.dispose();
```

## Security Model

### Sandboxing
- Plugins run in isolated contexts
- Limited access to browser APIs
- No direct DOM manipulation outside designated areas

### Permission System
- Plugins declare required permissions
- Users can grant/revoke permissions
- Runtime permission checking

### Resource Limits
- Memory usage monitoring
- CPU time restrictions
- Network request limitations

## Performance Considerations

### Lazy Loading
- Plugins loaded only when needed
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Metadata-only scanning for discovery

### Resource Management
- Automatic cleanup on deactivation
- Memory leak prevention
- Event listener disposal

### Rendering Optimization
- Layer-based rendering system
- Selective updates
- Canvas viewport culling

## Plugin Types

### Tool Plugins
Add new drawing and interaction tools:
- Implement `ToolDefinition` interface
- Handle mouse/keyboard events
- Provide custom cursors and UI

### Layer Plugins
Render custom content on the canvas:
- React components as SVG layers
- Z-index management
- Viewport-aware rendering

### Service Plugins
Provide functionality to other plugins:
- Export utility functions
- Share state management
- Implement common patterns

### Integration Plugins
Connect with external services:
- File import/export
- Cloud synchronization
- Third-party APIs

## Extension Points

### Canvas Events
- `element:created`
- `element:updated` 
- `element:deleted`
- `selection:changed`
- `canvas:zoom`
- `canvas:pan`

### Tool Events
- `tool:activated`
- `tool:deactivated`
- Mouse and keyboard events

### UI Events
- `ui:theme:changed`
- `ui:sidebar:toggled`
- Custom component events

## Data Flow

### Plugin Activation
1. Plugin manager loads plugin metadata
2. Dependency resolution and validation
3. Plugin constructor called with API
4. Plugin registers tools, layers, and event handlers
5. Plugin marked as active

### Event Processing
1. User interaction triggers event
2. Core system emits typed event
3. Subscribed plugins receive event
4. Plugins process event and update state
5. UI re-renders based on state changes

### Plugin Deactivation
1. Plugin cleanup method called
2. All disposables automatically disposed
3. Event listeners removed
4. UI components unregistered
5. Memory cleanup performed

## Best Practices

### State Management
- Use isolated state stores (Zustand recommended)
- Avoid global state pollution
- Implement proper state persistence

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation on errors
- Proper error logging and reporting
- Recovery mechanisms

### Testing
- Unit tests for plugin logic
- Integration tests with mock API
- End-to-end testing for user workflows

### Documentation
- Clear API documentation
- Usage examples
- Migration guides for updates

This architecture ensures that plugins are powerful, safe, and maintainable while providing a great developer experience.
